### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Q: How do you determine which features in a dataset might be important for predicting player churn?

When predicting player churn, I start with a thorough EDA to identify potential features that might influence a player's likelihood to churn. 
I begin by analyzing user engagement metrics such as session length, frequency of play, and in-game purchases. 
I look for patterns and trends, such as a decline in daily active use or a drop-off in engagement after certain levels or events in the game.

Next, I utilize correlation analysis to see which features are strongly associated with churn. 
I also use visualization tools like heatmaps and scatter plots to spot relationships visually. 
After identifying a list of potential predictors, I prioritize them based on their correlation coefficients and the insights gathered during EDA. 
This helps me to focus on the most impactful features when building the churn prediction model.

### Statistical Analysis

#### Q: What statistical methods do you use to validate your findings in a dataset?

To validate my findings, I employ a variety of statistical methods, ensuring the results are statistically significant and not due to random chance. 
For example, if I observe a pattern or trend, I first use hypothesis testing to check the validity of the results. 
I might use a t-test or ANOVA when comparing means across different groups, or a chi-square test for categorical variables.
Additionally, I employ regression analysis to understand the relationship between different variables and the outcome of interest. 
I check the p-values to assess the significance of each predictor and use the R-squared value to gauge the model's explanatory power. 
Lastly, I cross-validate findings using techniques like k-fold cross-validation, which helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

### Designing or Maintaining a Data Warehouse

#### Q: Have you designed or maintained a data warehouse before? What technologies did you use?
Yes, in my previous role, I was responsible for designing and maintaining a data warehouse that consolidated user 
data from different gaming platforms. We used Amazon Redshift as our data warehousing solution due to 
its scalability and compatibility with other AWS services. 
For the design, I focused on creating a star schema for optimizing query performance, which involved defining 
fact tables containing game metrics and dimension tables for descriptive attributes like user demographics and gameplay information.
This allowed for efficient reporting and complex analytical queries.

To maintain the data warehouse, I set up automated ETL processes using Apache Airflow to orchestrate the workflow and 
ensure data was regularly extracted from source systems, transformed into the desired format, and loaded into the warehouse.
We also used AWS Data Pipeline for some of the data movement tasks and Redshift's features like sort and distribution keys 
to optimize table structures for query performance. Regular monitoring and auditing were part of the maintenance process to 
guarantee data integrity and performance

### Developing an ETL Process

#### Q: Can you walk me through an ETL process you've developed?
Certainly. At my last job, I developed an ETL process to capture and transform player event data for real-time analytics.
The process began with extracting raw event data, which was generated by our games and sent to a Kafka stream every time 
a player completed an action, such as finishing a level or making an in-game purchase.

For the 'Extract' phase, I set up a consumer application that subscribed to the relevant Kafka topics to pull the event data 
in real-time. In the 'Transform' phase, the data was cleaned and enriched; for instance, we parsed JSON payloads, 
resolved any data discrepancies, and joined the event data with static user profiles stored in Amazon S3 to add context to the events.

Finally, during the 'Load' phase, the transformed data was loaded into a Google BigQuery data warehouse. I chose BigQuery
because of its ability to handle high-velocity data and support fast analytical queries, which was crucial for our real-time analytics requirements.

Throughout this process, I used Apache Beam for its stream and batch processing capabilities, which provided the 
flexibility to handle our data's velocity and volume. We also included data quality checks at each stage to ensure the reliability of our ETL pipeline.
